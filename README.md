# 💫 About Me:
Hi! I’m a Cybersecurity student with a strong interest in Security Operations Center (SOC) roles. I am passionate about understanding how cyber threats are detected, analyzed, and mitigated in real-world environments.

I continuously improve my technical skills through hands-on practice, including CTF challenges and practical lab exercises. I am particularly interested in network security, log analysis, digital forensics, and incident response. My goal is to build a strong technical foundation and develop into a skilled SOC analyst who can effectively protect and monitor organizational systems.
